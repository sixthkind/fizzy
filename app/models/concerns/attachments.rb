  # The variants we use must all declared here so that we can preprocess them.

  # If they are not preprocessed, then Rails will attempt to transform the image on-the-fly when
  # they are first viewed, which may be on the read replica where writing to the database is not
  # allowed. Chaos will ensue if that happens.
  #
  # These variants are patched into ActionText::RichText in config/initializers/action_text.rb

    # the gif can be rendered with all its frame intact.
    #
    # Only `n` is accepted as an override, using the full parameter name `intent` doesn’t work.

    # This was cargo-culted from know-it-all and I imagine it may be fixed at some point.
